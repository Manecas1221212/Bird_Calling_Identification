# Bird_Calling_Identification
My participation in Kaggle's BirdClef 23 challenge : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2023

This was my first audio data competition and I must say it was very fun.
The challenge was to correctly classify the sounds of more than 250 different bird species.

Throughout the course of this project, I explored various methodologies, initially beginning with audio models and ultimately transitioning to spectrogram classification, a popular approach adopted by many participants. I extensively experimented with different augmentation techniques and explored diverse methods for upsampling the data.

In terms of modeling, I employed a Transformer architecture, leveraging the capabilities provided by the Timm library. This allowed me to harness the power and flexibility of pre-existing models, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the classification task.
